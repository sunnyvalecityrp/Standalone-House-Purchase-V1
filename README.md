# Standalone-House-Purchase-V1
This script enables players to buy, explore, and exit houses on standalone FiveM servers. Configure locations in server.lua and client interactions in client.lua. Currently, it doesn't save house data between server restarts or player logins. Feedback and suggestions are appreciated!
